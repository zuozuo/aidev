## Core Principles
1. The user requirement is the single source of truth for all development. All the user requirements will be documented in the docs/user_requirement.md file.
2. You should always refer to the user requirement when you are not sure about the user requirement.
3. All codes must be generated strictly following the user requirement.
4. Any changes to requirements must be reflected in the docs/user_requirement.md file first.
5. No code changes should be made without corresponding to user requirement changes.

## Design Doc
[Design Doc](docs/design_doc.md)

## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis
   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
   - Identify languages and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints
   - Generate a design doc following the format of docs/design_doc_example.md, and append it to the docs/design_doc.md file.

2. Solution Planning
   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify best practices alignment

## Iteration Requirement

Requirements are constantly evolving, and progressive iteration is always required.
It's crucial to pay close attention to the changes in requirements.
After each code change, you need to do the following:

1. Update the design document docs/design_doc.md.
2. Update the README.md file, following the format of README.md files from excellent open-source projects.
3. Generate a git commit message that summarizes the changes made to the code and the git commit command to commit the changes. 
4. Automically append the user request and llm response to file chat_history.md

## Code Style and Structure

### What you can build
Command-Line Automation Suite: Develop a command-line tool that automates repetitive tasks such as file management, text processing, and data transformation using Python and rich CLI interfaces powered by click and prompt-toolkit.Interactive Data Validation Tool: Create a command-line application that validates and processes data files (e.g., CSV, JSON) using pydantic for type checking, offering rich text feedback using rich and progress tracking with tqdm.Template-Based Report Generator: Design a tool for generating customizable reports from templates using jinja2, allowing users to specify parameters through an interactive command-line interface.Clipboard Manager with Text Formatting: Build a clipboard manager that supports rich text formatting and unicode operations using pyperclip and colorama, suitable for developers and writers who frequently copy and paste code snippets.Interactive File System Navigator: Implement a command-line tool for exploring and manipulating file systems with an intuitive interface, personalized shortcuts, and enhanced visualization using tabulate for directory listings.Real-Time Command-Line Chat Interface: Develop a real-time messaging application for the command line that uses prompt-toolkit for interactions and colorama for colored messages, suitable for developer collaboration in server environments.Code Snippet Tokenization Utility: Create a utility that tokenizes and analyzes code snippets or text inputs using tiktoken, providing insights and statistics through a user-friendly command-line interface.Progressive Learning CLI Quizzes: Design a command-line quiz application that quizzes users on Python and software development topics, utilizing click for user interactions and tqdm for progress visualization.Poetry-Based Dependency Manager with UI: Enhance the poetry dependency manager by integrating a user interface for managing Python project dependencies through the terminal, simplifying package version updates and installation tasks.Pyperclip Enhanced Copy-Paste Tool: Build a tool that extends clipboard functionalities, offering options for auto-formatting and macro operations directly from the command line.

### code structure
1. put all the code in the src directory
2. put all the test code in the test directory
3. put all the config code in the config directory
4. put all the data code in the data directory
5. put all the doc code in the doc directory    

## Synopsis
Developers working on Python command-line tools and file operations can create modular, efficient, and well-documented CLI applications with robust text formatting, templating, and data validation features.

## Overview of .cursorrules prompt
The .cursorrules file outlines the responsibilities and attributes of an elite software developer skilled in Python, command-line tools, and file system operations. It emphasizes a pragmatic approach to coding, modular design, principled coding practices like KISS and DRY, and the importance of documentation and testing. The developer is expected to have a functional programming preference and work with a technological stack that includes Python 3.6+, alongside various dependencies such as `rich`, `click`, `jinja2`, `prompt-toolkit`, and others for building robust command-line applications and ensuring code quality through testing and validation.


### General Principles
- Write concise, readable Python code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

### Python Usage
- Use Python for all code
- Implement proper type safety and inference

## Python Best Practices

## Testing and Validation

### Code Quality
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write maintainable, self-documenting code
- Follow security best practices
- Ensure proper type coverage
- Use ESLint and Prettier

### Testing Strategy
- Plan for unit and integration tests
- Implement proper test coverage
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Validate accessibility compliance

Remember: Prioritize clarity and maintainability while delivering robust, accessible, and performant solutions aligned with the latest Python features and best practices.
